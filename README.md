*Task 1: Software configuration*

Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hi! My name is Ania and I would like to be a software tester. 
I decided to join to Challenge_portfolio because I'd like to familiar with base of 
automating of tests. Also I would like to check if it's interesting for me.
Also It is a chance for me to create some project to my portfolio and gaine
some experiences. Additionally I can practise my english.

I'm really happy that I can take part in this challenge!
